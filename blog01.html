        <h1>My Journey to level 1</h1>

        <p>
            Hey Everyone!<br>
            Before we start, here's a head's up about me. <br>
            My name is Nitin Kalra, Graduated in CSE from Amity University. Currently working as a developer.<br>
            <br>
            So, I started my journey 10 days ago around 20th September and I'm writing this on the very last day of submission ie 30th Sept 2021. Till now, I've completed 13 marks and with this being 14th and one more to go. I have been late to the party, rushing things, trying my best to complete level 0 before the deadline and it finally seems like I'd be able to submit within time.<br>
            Am I sure If I'd make it to level 1? <br>
            TBH, no but regardless I'm certain that I'd suceed in learning React and would hopefully land a well paying project.

        </p>


        <h2>Why am I learning React?</h2>

        <p>
            
            To be honest, one of the reason is to have a skill that can land a great job in this market but moreover the motivation that fuels me is to be able to build things on my owm. <br>
            <br>
            <a target="_blank" href = "https://twitter.com/naval">Naval</a> said "If you can build and sell, you'd be unstopable" and I believe in that.

            <br>
            Apart from that, while learning I've also found it very Interesting. Was watching a video form varun and tanay yesterday and one of them said "Your mind is biologically designed to solve problems" I think it was tanay and he was bang on.

            Anyways, That's it, it must be 250 wods I guess and i've a project to finish + I've to check everything before submitting. <br>
            
            <br>If you've really read this far,<br> Bro, How free are you?
            Jokes aside, hmu on twitter, let's connect.

            Until they, Seeya!!!
