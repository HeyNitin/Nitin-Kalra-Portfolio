        <h1>My Experience at Amity University</h1>

        <p>
            Hey There! <br>
            I'm assuming you've read my first blog and that would have given you an idea about me. In this blog, I'd be sharing my experience at Amity University. <br>
            <br>
            I'm wriitin this in Sept 2021 and I've spent 4 amazing years (3 and a half tbh, thanks to covid ) at Amity University. I enrolled in computer science back in 2016 at Jaipur campus, having no idea of what 'code' means. And safe to say I graduated without having much as well. So I was not great on academics part but that's just not that.<br>

            <br> Life at Amity was above and beyond good. I was part of my college's E-cell, even led it for later on and it was so much fun. I also learnt Martial arts, though had to leave in middle due to some reason. This is going to be a bit unstructured but gonna talb about a usual day at Amity in next Para.

        </p>


        <h2>A day in the life of Amity</h2>

        <p>
            Unless you're a scholar or one of those early birds, your day starts at 9AM when your alarm hits and you realise all you've is 15 minutes before the first lecture starts. You wake up, throw a chappal at your roommate to wake him up while brushing you teeths. Take a dump (Washrooms are almost always busy at this time of the day) and run to the department building.<br> But wait wait<br>
            buying yourself a watermelon juice from the grocery store is the culture so don't forget that. That's the breakfast fo most of us on week-days. Looks like 200 words are done and thus I'd write it later on, back to project for now.
